# Machine Coding Round Tasks

Welcome to the machine coding round! Below are the tasks you are required to complete. Each task is designed to assess your skills in front-end development using React, Redux, and related technologies.

## Tasks List:

### 1. Accordion Component
- **Description**: Implement an accordion component where users can expand/collapse sections to reveal content.
- **Approach**: Use React state to manage the open/close state of each section. Provide smooth animations for transitions.

### 2. Todo App with RTK (Redux Toolkit)
- **Description**: Develop a simple todo list application using Redux Toolkit for state management.
- **Approach**: Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks. Use RTK's `createSlice` for reducers and actions.

### 3. Random Color Generator
- **Description**: Create a tool that generates random colors.
- **Approach**: Use JavaScript to generate random RGB or HEX values. Implement a button to trigger color generation.

### 4. Random Background Changer
- **Description**: Develop a feature that changes the background color randomly.
- **Approach**: Utilize the random color generator from task #3. Bind the generated color to the background style of the page or a specific container.

### 5. Star Rating Component
- **Description**: Design a star rating component where users can rate items.
- **Approach**: Use SVG icons or Unicode stars. Manage state to reflect the selected rating and allow users to submit their rating.

### 6. Image Slider Component
- **Description**: Build an image slider that displays a slideshow of images.
- **Approach**: Implement navigation controls (previous/next) and autoplay options. Use CSS for transitions and animations.

### 7. Carousel Component
- **Description**: Create a carousel component that cycles through content items (e.g., images, cards).
- **Approach**: Design navigation controls and autoplay functionality. Ensure smooth transitions between items.

### 8. Pagination Component
- **Description**: Design a pagination component for navigating between pages of data.
- **Approach**: Implement pagination logic with buttons to move between pages. Consider dynamic rendering based on data size.

### 9. Load More Button
- **Description**: Implement a button that loads more data when clicked.
- **Approach**: Manage pagination state and fetch additional data from an API or local storage. Update UI dynamically without page refresh.

### 10. Light and Dark Mode using Context Hook
- **Description**: Develop a feature that toggles between light and dark mode.
- **Approach**: Use React Context API to manage theme state globally. Implement a toggle button to switch themes and update UI accordingly.

### 11. Scroll Indicator Component
- **Description**: Design a scroll indicator that shows the user's current position on the page.
- **Approach**: Utilize JavaScript to calculate scroll position relative to page height. Display progress visually (e.g., progress bar, percentage).

### 12. Modal Popup Component
- **Description**: Create a modal popup component that can display content or forms.
- **Approach**: Use React state to manage modal visibility. Allow customization of content and styles based on use case.

### 13. Custom Hook
- **Description**: Implement a custom React hook for a specific reusable functionality (e.g., form validation, local storage management).
- **Approach**: Create a hook function that encapsulates state and logic. Ensure it's easy to integrate and reuse across different components.

### 14. React Router DOM Integration
- **Description**: Set up routing for a React application using React Router DOM.
- **Approach**: Define routes for different pages or components. Use `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Link` components to handle navigation.

### 15. Redux Store Integration
- **Description**: Set up a Redux store and integrate it with a React application to manage state.
- **Approach**: Use Redux for state management. Define actions, reducers, and connect components to the store using `react-redux`.

### 16. Infinite Scroll Component
- **Description**: Develop a component that loads more data as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Approach**: Implement infinite scrolling using Intersection Observer API or custom scroll event listeners. Fetch additional data and append it to the existing list dynamically.

### 17. Quiz Application
- **Description**: Develop a quiz application where users can answer multiple-choice questions and see their score at the end.
- **Approach**: Design a quiz UI with questions fetched from an API or stored locally. Track user answers and calculate scores dynamically. Display results at the end of the quiz.

## General Guidelines:
- **Technologies**: Use React.js and Redux as the primary frameworks for state management. Utilize additional libraries/frameworks as needed.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear instructions on how to run and test your solutions.
- **Quality**: Focus on clean code practices, readability, and efficiency.
- **Testing**: Optional, but consider adding unit tests for critical components or functionalities.
- **Time Management**: Allocate time based on task complexity; prioritize completion and functionality over perfection.
